This program is to calculate and print the commission received by a salesperson.
JamEx Limited requires a program to calculate and print the commission received by a
salesperson. The program should process an undetermined number of salespersons and
appropriately terminate by a predefined input. The commission rate is based on two factors,
the amount of sales and the class to which a salesperson belongs. The input will be the
salesperson number, sales amount and class. The commission rate will be based on the
following criteria:
Class=1
If sales is equal to or less than $1000, the rate is 6 percent.
If sales is greater than $1000 but less than $2000, the rate is 7 percent.
If the sales is $2000 or greater, the rate is 10 percent.
Class=2
If the sales is less than $1000, the rate is 4 percent.
If the sales is $1000 or greater, the rate is 6 percent.
